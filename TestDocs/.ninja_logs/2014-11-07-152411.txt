junk.c:7:  [4.0] (buffer) fscanf: 
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits 
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a 
  different input function. 
junk.c:9:  [4.0] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). 
junk.c:5:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length.
